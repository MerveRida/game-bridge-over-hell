# game-bridge-over-hell

This is a 3D game made in Unity where a ball first goes around and collects points. Next, the user tries to make the ball pass over the bridge without falling off. The number of points collected in the first round will influence how hard or easy it is to pass the bridge. (game originally made in Turkish, might be translated to other languages in the future) (available to play on: https://merve-rida.itch.io/sirat-koprusu)
